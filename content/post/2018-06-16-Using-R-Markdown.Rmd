## R Markdown
This is some clever stuff. I was first introduced to it by a co-worker who mentioned **Jupyter Notebooks** (another nifty tool) and I didn't see the huge appeal and the applications of it until recently. The same co-worker wanted a R script documented and put into words how it was done.  

I thought why not use the comments amongst the code and go from there but not everyone will want to read through code and possibly have to scroll back through the console looking for outputs amongst the processes performed on the data. That's where **R Markdown** comes in. Time to make this code look somewhat professional and more importantly tell the **story/journey** of the data.
