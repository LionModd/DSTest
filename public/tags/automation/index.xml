      <description>Packages Usedlibrary(taskscheduleR)library(boxr)Data prep seems to be a common task required for anything involving data, something even as simple as renaming columns. Let’s say every Monday morning you have to pull a report and manipulate it, why not automate this so you don’t have to lose 20 minutes every Monday? I’ve been thinking recently how to automate the reports being pulled and then using R to prep this data and then following on from this, have data vizualisation auto refresh the data.</description>
