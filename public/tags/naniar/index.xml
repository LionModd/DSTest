      <description>Packages Usedlibrary(tidyverse) # Data preplibrary(h2o) # Automated machine learninglibrary(naniar) # Identifying missing datalibrary(funModeling) # Quick histograms for featureslibrary(Hmisc) # Statistical summarieslibrary(caret) # Confusion matricesI came across a dataset that peaked my interest in something I enjoy watching, boxing. The data has been scrapped from a boxing bout website with a large quantity of data available. Using this data we can try to predict winners of each bout with automated machine learning.</description>

      <description>Packages usedlibrary(naniar)library(nycflights13)library(tidyverse)library(UpSetR)library(kableExtra)Missing data can skew results and cause problems but if we can come up with a suitable method(s) to rectify it we can include it (depending on the problem). But maybe we want to get an overview of the missing data and possibly identify patterns of missing data e.g.Â if column A is missing then so is column B.
Visualising missing dataThe UpSetR package is fantastic.</description>
