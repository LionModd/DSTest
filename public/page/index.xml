      <description>I am by no means a data scientist, modeller or analyst. I have no association with any data or technology firms. I merely struggle with basic tasks, concepts and ideas involving data and like to have a crack at solving/understanding them. The solutions/concepts if you decide to adopt them may not work for your particular problem and no responsibility attributed to datastruggle.life. 
&amp;ldquo;If there is no struggle, there is no progress.</description>
