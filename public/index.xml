      <description>R MarkdownThis is some clever stuff. I was first introduced to it by a co-worker who mentioned Jupyter Notebooks (another nifty tool) and I didn’t see the huge appeal and the applications of it until recently. The same co-worker wanted a R script documented and put into words how it was done.
I thought why not use the comments amongst the code and go from there but not everyone will want to read through code and possibly have to scroll back through the console looking for outputs amongst the processes performed on the data.</description>

      <description> I am NOT a data scientist, mordeller or analyst. I&amp;rsquo;m not anything involving data. I merely struggle with basic tasks, concepts and ideas involving data and like to have a crack at solving/understanding them. The solutions/concepts may not work for your problem.

&amp;ldquo;If there is no struggle, there is no progress.&amp;rdquo; - Frederick Douglas </description>
